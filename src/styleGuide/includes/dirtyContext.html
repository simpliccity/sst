<p>The <code>SpringJUnit4ClassRunner</code> JUnit test runner by default initializes the Spring
context once before any of the tests in a test class are run.  If the individual tests 
themselves can modify the application context or the state of any of the beans it manages, 
it may, instead, be necessary to reload the context more frequently.  Spring test support 
provides a number of ways to control how the runner class manages the application context.</p>
