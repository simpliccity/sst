<p>For integration tests that require database access, ensuring repeatable test results 
when relying on an externally hosted database can become particularly complex.  Issues of 
availability and data content can be difficult, if not impossible, to manage effectively 
from within the test.</p>

<p>Alternatively, using an in-memory database that can be configured on the fly, fully under
the control of the test, can provide a flexible option to reduce external dependencies and
ensure repeatable tests.  The following code snippets illustrate various aspects of using
an embeddable (in-memory) database for integration testing with Spring and JUnit.</p>
